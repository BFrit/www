# Debian Astro - A "Debian Pure Blend" for Astronomy and Astrophysics

## [Ole Streicher](../../speaker/TXTNZZ/)

Debian Astro is a way to improve the ecosystem of astronomical software. Astronomical software with appropriate licenses is packaged and distributed together with all necessary dependencies as an integral part of the Debian distribution. Debian GNU/Linux is an open distribution with an open development model and a standardized build and installation process. This ensures high stability and reliability of the software as well as reproducibility, which is important in a scientific environment. Continious integration and regular testing on various platforms help to maintain a high quality of the software packages.
