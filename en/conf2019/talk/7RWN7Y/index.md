# Data mining made easy, reproducible and open-source

## [Alexander Bartholom√§us](../../speaker/RCSKUH/)

The Challenge: Exponential increase in amounts of data from new microbial environments and non-model organisms requires ‚Äútailor-made‚Äù data mining solutions that are costly and frequently unavailable.  The Vision: Simple data screening and analysis using a reproducible and easy to share open- source software environment.  Shared interest of bioinformatic vision and microbiologist needs generated a generic visualization tool that can approach specific biological questions with the push of a button. We aim to present our project from the first steps of setting the needs and ideas to developed solutions and discuss our vision regarding scientific data analysis, review and publication.
