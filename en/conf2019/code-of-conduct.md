# Code of Conduct for deRSE19

The organizers of deRSE19 are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), technology choices, or other group status.

To make clear what is expected, **everyone taking part in deRSE19** — speakers, helpers, organizers, and participants — **is required to conform to the [Berlin Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org/)**. This includes the main conference itself as well as any affiliated events, including social events or informal meetings outside of the conference venue.

The full text of the Code of Conduct can be found at <http://berlincodeofconduct.org/>.

To give a brief overview here, **you are expected to**:

- participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community;
- exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions;
- attempt collaboration before conflict;
- refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech;
- be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

The **following behaviour is unacceptable**:

- intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business.

Harrassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides); inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

If you **witness** or **are subject to unacceptable behaviour**, please contact one of the conference organizers. You can do so anonymously. The organizers are listed on this website under [Contact]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link en/conf2019/contact.md %}).
