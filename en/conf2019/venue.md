## Getting there

### Car

### Plane

Potsdam does not have an own airport. But since Potsdam is close to Berlin, you can fly into Berlin-Tegel or Berlin-Schönefeld. Below you find instructions how to get to Potsdam once you landed. For instructions after arriving at Potsdam main station, please read the section Public Transport > From Potsdam main station to Telegrafenberg.

#### Via Berlin-Tegel

Outside the airport building you will find German transport busses (BVG). You can take either X9 or 109.

Bus No. X9 will take you to the station Zoologischer Garten, this takes about 20 minutes. There you can change to the railway (any RE-train with a stop in Potsdam Hauptbahnhof), the RE-train departs every 30 minutes and takes roughly 20 minutes to get to Potsdam. You may also take the city train S-Bahn (S7) which leaves every 10 minutes (direction Potsdam Hauptbahnhof) and takes about 35 minutes to Potsdam.

Bus 109 from Tegel airport, takes you also to Zoologischer Garten, but you can get off already at station Charlottenburg and take the S7 from there, this will take a total of 55 minutes.

#### Via Berlin-Schönefeld

The following connections exist from Berlin-Schönefeld Airport: The walk to the S-Bahn station Berlin Schönefeld Airport takes about 6 minutes. There, take the S-Bahn S9 in the direction of Spandau and get off at the Treptower Park station. Change at station Treptower Park to S-Bahn S41 direction Gesundbrunnen or Schöneberg and get off at station Westkreuz. Take the S-Bahn S7 in the direction of Potsdam Hbf.

### Public Transport

Potsdam has no stop for highspeed trains. But since Potsdam is close to Berlin, you can go there.

For connections to get to Berlin Hbf check [German Railway (Deutsche Bahn)](https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml).

#### From Berlin

On arrival by train at the Berlin main station take the regional train (RE-train) departing from platform 13 or the S-Bahn (S7), platform 16, both located on the upper floor, in order to go to Potsdam. The S-Bahn stops more often but leaves more frequently.

To reach Potsdam, you need only one ticket, a Berlin-ABC ticket (it costs 3,40 EUR). You can obtain it from the bus driver or at the underground or S-Bahn station at a ticket machine. When obtaining your ticket from the ticket machine, please make sure to validate your ticket by stamping it (red box, next to the ticket machine) before entering the train. If you buy the ticket from the bus driver it is valid immediately.

#### From Potsdam main station to Telegrafenberg

From Potsdam main station you can either take a bus, a taxi, or walk.

##### Bus

On working days, a minibus (No. 691) leaves Potsdam main station (platform 7) heading towards ‘Einstein-Wissenschaftspark’ in the mornings and in the evenings.

##### Walking

Walking takes about 25 minutes: From the train station take the exit 'Friedrich Engels Str.', cross the tram- and bus-station as well as the Friedrich Engels street, take the footpath (50 m) to the next parallel street (Heinrich Mann Allee), cross it at the traffic light and walk uphill 100 m to the next traffic light. There you turn into 'Albert-Einstein-Str.' which first leads you through a small residential area and then through a wooded area. Finally it ends right at the gate of the 'Einstein-Wissenschaftspark'.
