### Train / Public transport

#### To Berlin Hbf

Potsdam has no ICE stop, but is close to Berlin. It makes sense to choose a connection to [Berlin Hauptbahnhof](https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml) and from there to use the trains of public transport to Potsdam.

#### From Berlin Hbf to Potsdam Hbf

After arriving in Berlin, change to the upper level of the station. From here the regional express RE1 direction Magdeburg or Brandenburg can be taken from the track 13 or 14 to Potsdam main station, which runs every 30 minutes and needs about 25 minutes to Potsdam.

It is also possible to use the S-Bahn S7 towards Potsdam Hbf from platform 16, which runs every 10 minutes and takes about 35 minutes to get there.

In order to drive to Potsdam, a ticket of the price category ABC is required for the price of € 3.40. This can be purchased on the bus or at the platform, in the underground or S-Bahn station at the ticket machines. If the ticket is purchased at the ticket machine this must be canceled. This is near the ticket machine before boarding the train. If the ticket is purchased from the bus driver, it does not need to be validated.
