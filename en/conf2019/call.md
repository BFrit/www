# deRSE19 conference - call for contributions


Following the success of the [first three international Conference of Research Software Engineers in the UK](https://rse.ac.uk/events/past-conferences/), a national conference addressing research software and the people behind it within the German research landscape will be held at the Albert Einstein Science Park in Potsdam on 4-6 June 2019.

The organising committee welcome submissions for workshops and talks for the deRSE19 conference. The aim is to reflect the diverse community of research software engineers by seeking input from a variety of domains, geographic locations, gender, ethnicities and experience.

## Timeline

- 2019-03-01 - Deadline for submissions
- 2019-03-22 - Notification of acceptance
- 2019-06-06 - deRSE19 conference

Successful submissions are expected to attend the conference.

## Conference sessions, themes and types of contribution

There are no pre-defined session themes. So, you do not need to and cannot select a specific sessions when submitting your contribution. The conference aims to host your talks and posters, workshops, splinter-meetings and birds of a feather (BoF). Submissions for talks and posters will be distributed into sessions by the organizing committee, based on all submitted material. Workshops, splinter-meetings and birds of a feather will be arranged equally to sessions.

## Who should apply?

We welcome submissions from any and all people who have an interesting take on research software development, including:

- Researchers at any career stage who develop software for research purposes
- Software developers working in a research context, whatever their job title or field
- Funders and decision makers paving the way for sustainable research software with grants and other instruments
- Those interested in advancing the understanding of how best to use and maintain research software, e.g. with respect to openness, reproducibility, sustainability or scalability and performance
- People from any organisation providing tools, platforms or services that benefit research software, such as IT infrastructure providers or computing and data centres.

We’re aiming for a well-balanced programme that includes a wide variety of perspectives to reflect the diversity of the RSE community and its activities. Similar conferences in other countries in the past found that social sciences and humanities were under-represented so we’d particularly like to encourage speakers from those areas to apply. We are not just looking for seasoned presenters or people who are already well known. Thus speakers from under-represented backgrounds and at early career stages are highly encouraged to submit a proposal.

We will do our best to keep the submissions review  process as anonymous as possible and will not consider an author’s name and affiliation when evaluating a submission. Please aid us by not including identifying information in your submission unless absolutely necessary.

## First-time presenter?

We want you to present! It’s important that the program includes people who don’t normally publish papers or attend academic conferences, otherwise we’ll be missing whole sections of the RSE community.

It’s not intimidating! The emphasis of the conference is on learning from each other in a supportive atmosphere. Your perspective is welcome and this will be a great chance to start a wider discussion of issues you care about.

We can help! We can offer mentoring and other support with preparing your presentation. Please email us if you require advice or clarification before making a submission. We can offer one on one mentoring to help successful applicants prepare their talk, poster or workshop – just tick the box when submitting your proposal.

If you have any questions about the conference, please contact the conference organisers at [konferenz@de-rse.org](mailto:konferenz@de-rse.org).
