# deRSE19 - Call for contributions

Following the success of the [first three international Conference of Research Software Engineers in the UK](https://rse.ac.uk/events/past-conferences/), a national conference addressing research software and the people behind it within the German research landscape will be held at the Albert Einstein Science Park in Potsdam on 4-6 June 2019.

The organising committee welcome submissions for workshops, talks, and posters for the deRSE19 conference. The aim is to reflect the diverse community of research software engineers by seeking input from a variety of domains, geographic locations, gender, ethnicities and experience.

## Timeline

- 2018-12-01 - We are open for submissions
- 2019-03-01 - Deadline for submissions
- 2019-03-22 - Notification of acceptance
- 2019-06-06 - deRSE19 conference

At least one author of successful submissions is expected to attend the conference to present.

## Conference sessions, themes and types of contribution

**deRSE19** has no pre-defined thematic tracks. Instead, sessions will be inductively created
by the programme committee from the submissions. If your submission addresses a
topic that you think is of interest to the community of people involved in
research software, we would love to see it submitted!

## Who should submit?

We welcome submissions from any and all people who have an interesting take on research software development, including:

- Researchers at any career stage who develop software for research purposes
- Software developers working in a research context, whatever their job title or field
- Funders and decision makers paving the way for sustainable research software with grants and other instruments
- Those interested in advancing the understanding of how best to use and maintain research software, e.g. with respect to openness, reproducibility, sustainability or scalability and performance
- People from any organisation providing tools, platforms or services that benefit research software, such as IT infrastructure providers or computing and data centres.

We’re aiming for a well-balanced programme that includes a wide variety of perspectives to reflect the diversity of the RSE community and its activities. Similar conferences in other countries in the past found that social sciences and humanities were under-represented so we’d particularly like to encourage speakers from those areas to apply. We are not just looking for seasoned presenters or people who are already well known. Thus, speakers from under-represented backgrounds and at early career stages are highly encouraged to submit a proposal.

We will select talks and workshops through a double-blind review process: reviewers will not see authors’ names and affiliations. Please aid us by not including identifying information in your submission unless absolutely necessary.

## First-time presenter?

We want you to present! It’s important that the programme includes people who don’t normally publish papers or attend academic conferences, otherwise we’ll be missing whole sections of the RSE community.

It’s not intimidating! The emphasis of the conference is on learning from each other in a supportive atmosphere. Your perspective is welcome and this will be a great chance to start a wider discussion of issues you care about.

We can help! We can offer mentoring and other support with preparing your presentation. Please email us if you require advice or clarification before making a submission. We can possibly offer one-on-one mentoring to help successful applicants prepare their talk, poster or workshop – just tick the box when submitting your proposal.

If you have any questions about the conference, please contact the conference organisers at [konferenz@de-rse.org](mailto:konferenz@de-rse.org).

## Technicalities

The focus of deRSE19 is on community. Therefore, instead of asking you to submit an academic abstract
following a specific structure, submissions to deRSE19 are a little more free form.

Simply fill out the submission form at <https://xxx>. The form includes a field
for the description of your submission ("abstract") as well as several others,
asking you for details about yourself. We elicit this information because we
would like to know a little about your background, your perspective, your
experience. This will help us to get to know the RSE community in Germany better.

### Formats

#### Workshops

Workshops are interactive sessions that give attendees the chance to collaborate
on a specific topic. They may take different forms, e.g., as hands-on tutorial,
discussion and [speed-blogging](https://www.software.ac.uk/term/speed-blogging)
session, hack session, etc.

Workshops run over a length of *one or more 1.5 hour sessions*.

#### Talks

Talks may have a length of 15-30 mins. + time for Q&A and discussion, depending
on the number of talks in the respective session. If your talk is accepted, you
will be notified about the length of the talk by the session chair.

#### Posters

Posters are be used to present an overview of an idea, a project, a
collaboration, etc. The poster chairs will let you know the technical details,
such as size, etc., if your poster is accepted. Please be prepared to give a
very short presentation about the contents of your poster in a "lightning talk"
(a talk of nore more than 2 minutes). This will help attendees of the poster
session identify the posters and people they want to look at and talk to.
