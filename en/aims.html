        <h1>What is a Research Software Engineer?</h1>
        <p>A growing number of people in academia combine expertise in programming with an
           intricate understanding of research. Although this combination of skills is
           extremely valuable, these people lack a formal place in the academic system.
           This means there is no easy way to recognise their contribution, to reward
           them, or to represent their views.</p>
           
        <p>Without a name, it is difficult for people to rally around a cause, so we
           created the term Research Software Engineer. We are now working to raise
           awareness of the role and bring the community together.</p>
           
        <p>Some Research Software Engineers start off as researchers who spend time
           developing software to progress their research. Because they enjoy this work
           and have invested in developing specialist skills, they continue to focus on
           software and its use in research. Others start off from a more conventional
           software-development background and are drawn to research by the challenge of
           using software to further research.</p>
           
        <p>The attraction of being a Research Software Engineer is similar to that of
           being a researcher: the role attracts people who want to know how the world
           works. The Research Software Engineer works with researchers to gain an
           understanding of the problems they face, and then develops, maintains and
           extends software to provide the answers.</p>
        <h2>Are you a Research Software Engineer?</h2>
        <p>Regardless of your formal job title, if you answer yes to many of
           the following questions, you are doing the work of a Research Software
           Engineer:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Are you employed to develop software for research?</li>
          <li>Are you spending more time developing software than conducting
              research?</li> 
          <li>Are you employed as a postdoctoral researcher, even though you
              predominantly work on software development?</li>
          <li>Are you the person who does computers in your research group?</li>
          <li>Are you sometimes not named on research papers despite playing a
              fundamental part in developing the software used to create them?</li>
          <li>Do you lack the metrics needed to progress your academic career,
              like papers and conference presentations, despite having made
              a significant contribution through software?</li>
        </ol>
