        <h1>Objectives</h1>
        <p>
          Our contribution to the developing science landscape and IT-dependent research 
          is mainly, but not exclusively, in the area of research software development. We want 
          to prepare science for the ever-increasing influence of new technologies and new 
          IT concepts, and help to cope with the challenges of the increasing digitalisation 
          of research as well as exploit the resulting opportunities. To this end, we aim to 
          address the following challenges:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ensuring the sustainability and evaluability of research software 
            development as part of research processes;
          </li>
          <li>
            Improving the perception of the role of software in research as the 
            foundation of publications and research data, as well as the link between them;
          </li>
          <li>
            Opening up of research software as a key building block in Open Science;
          </li>
          <li>
            Linking software publications to the scientific reputation system through 
            consistent application of DOIs, referencing, metrics and reviews;
          </li>
          <li>
            Supporting the professionalization of software development in research 
            through trainings, and the application of minimally necessary best practices 
            from software engineering;
          </li>
          <li>
            Establishing research software engineering as an essential core competence, 
            especially among young scientists, the next generation of researchers;
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrating research software engineering with higher-level activities, 
            e.g., in the context of e-Science and e-Infrastructures;
          </li>
          <li>
            Facilitating job advertisements and job searches by creating a generic 
            term, as well as increasing the attractiveness of the related occupational field.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Last but not least, we give ourselves a voice, and represent our interests 
          together in order to achieve our goals within the German science landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to achieve our objectives, the following activities are already 
          being carried out or are planned:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Providing a forum for the exchange of computer scientists, software developers, 
            RSEs and scientists developing in and for research;
          </li>
          <li>
            Running Software Carpentry (SWC) workshops or workshops that follow the SWC concept;
          </li>
          <li>
            Implementing a Fellowship Programme in which ambassadors represent and realise 
            the aims of the German RSE community locally, regionally, nationally and internationally;
          </li>
          <li>
            Running an annual research software conference not exclusively 
            covering software engineering and not exclusively addressing RSEs;
          </li>
          <li>
            Establishing RSE teams in research institutes, universities and other scientific 
            institutions and organizations;
          </li>
          <li>
            Setting up a national center for research software, covering the German 
            research landscape, and embeddeing it in the e-Science and e-Infrastructure movement
          </li>
        </ul>
