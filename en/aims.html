        <p>
          Our contribution in the changing science landscape and the IT-dependent research 
          is mainly, but not only, in the area of scientific software development. We want 
          to prepare science for the ever-increasing influence of new technologies and new 
          IT concepts, and help to cope with the challenges of the increasing digitalisation 
          of research and to exploit the resulting opportunities. To this end, we aim to 
          address the following challenges:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ensuring the sustainability and falsifiability of scientific software 
            development as part of research processes;
          </li>
          <li>
            Improving the perception of the role of software in research as the 
            foundation of publications and research data, as well as their link;
          </li>
          <li>
            Opening up of scientific software as a key building block in Open Science;
          </li>
          <li>
            Anchoring of software publications in the scientific value system through 
            the consequent application of DOIs, referencing, metrics and reviews;
          </li>
          <li>
            Supporting the professionalization of software development in research 
            through trainings and the application of minimal necessary best practices 
            from software engineering;
          </li>
          <li>
            Establishing research software engineering as an essential core competence, 
            especially among young scientists, the next generation of researchers;
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrating research software engineering into higher-level activities, 
            i.e. in the context of e-Science and e-Infrastructures;
          </li>
          <li>
            Facilitating job advertisements and job searches by creating a generic 
            term as well as increasing the attractiveness of the related occupational area.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And last but not least, we give ourselves a voice and represent our interests 
          together to achieve our goals in the German science landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to achieve our objectives, the following activities are already 
          being carried out or are planned:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Providing a forum for the exchange of computer scientists, software developers, 
            RSEs and scientists developing in and for research;
          </li>
          <li>
            Running Software Carpentry (SWC) workshops or workshops that follow the SWC concept;
          </li>
          <li>
            Implementing a Fellowship Program in which ambassadors represent and realize 
            the aims of the German RSE community locally, regionally, nationally and internationally;
          </li>
          <li>
            Running an annual research software conference not only 
            covering software engineering and not only for RSEs;
          </li>
          <li>
            Establishing RSE teams in research institutes, universities and other scientific 
            institutions and organizations;
          </li>
          <li>
            Setting up a national center for research software, covering the German 
            research landscape and embedded in the e-Science and e-Infrastructure movement
          </li>
        </ul>
