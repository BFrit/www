I am a test draft.
You can use me as a template.

Check out the [kramdown documentation]() to see how you can do what.
It's simple, really.

Once you're finished, save me under a new name (e.g., "my-real-draft.md") in the `_drafts` directory (where I also live).
Then, run `rake publish` and pick me from all the drafts listed, to publish me.

Once you're done, simply push your clone of the `master` branch back to your repository, and create a *pull request* against `master` on [my repository](https://github.com/DE-RSE/www).

You're done :).
