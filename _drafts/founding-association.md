One question regularly arises since we have come together as a community to make de-RSE a real supporter for our daily work:
What organisational and legal form is suitable to realise our [goals](http://www.de-rse.org/en/aims.html)?

It seems clear that a loosely coupled group of willing people will not be able to build supportive structures for the long term, for example:

* running a website (including https encryption for commenting),
* organise workshops,
* support enganged people in their RSE missions,
* establish an annual conference on the topic of scientific software, and
* create a national centre for scientific software overarching all of the German research landscape.

An impromptu meeting at the [2nd S3-Konferenz in Hannover, May 2017](https://events.tib.eu/nontextualinformation2017/) ([recordings](https://av.tib.eu/series/310/2nd+conference+on+non+textual+information+software+and+services+for+science+s3+may+10+11+2017+in+hannover)) Hendrik Eggers (TU Braunschweig) suggested the foundation of a cooperative besides the founding of an association.

Bernadette Fritzsch (Alfred-Wegener-Institut, Helmholtz-Zentrum für Polar- und Meeresforschung) took up these first ideas and started a series of telephone conferences in autumn 2017.

## Current situation

Three conference calls by a group of seven took place.
The group came to the conclusion, that the founding of an association is more suitable.
We collaboratively (Slack channel `#verein`) developed a [charter](https://github.com/DE-RSE/satzung) and rules of operation (both in German).
The ultimate goal is a non-profit association, which utilises modern technology to allows a distributed collaboration.
More supporters are welcome!

## Name

What name should our association bear?
The abbreviation "de-RSE" seems settled.
The term Research Software Engineer establishes itself more and more, also internationally (just out: [nl-RSE.org](http://nl-rse.org)), and is not going to disappear any time soon.
But we also have the German occupations of "Wissenschaftlers" and "Ingenieurs", who seem to contradict each other at a first glance, although both may include software development.

At the moment the charter repository includes three suggestions:

* de-RSE e.V. - Research Software Engineers im deutschsprachigen Raum
* Förderverein für Forschungssoftware und Softwareentwickelnde in der Forschung in Deutschland (de-RSE)
* Förderverein für Softwareentwickelnde in der Forschung (de-RSE)

Personally I favour a mixture, maybe _de-RSE e.V.: Förderverein für Forschungssoftware und wissenschaftlich Software Entwickelnde_?
Maybe you, dear reader, have an illuminating idea for naming our association.
The name is going to be widely used and subject to noteworthy contexts::

* maximal inclusiveness towards all participants in a software development process ((computer) scientists, IT specialists, students, ...)
* collaboration on international level
* contact with research funders

We look forward to your feedback on the [mailing list and in the chat](http://www.de-rse.org/en/join.html).
And since we're talking already, let's address another important topic.

## Dues

Up to now the question of association dues has merely been touched.
But where wood is to be chopped, you need a tree first.
Also some cooperations with third parties are only possible given own resources.
We hope the search for a name is a good occassion to think about the personal opinion on financial support.
Everything is possible:

* free memberships
* support memberships
* donations
* institutional support

If I were asked today, I would be ready to pay 10 € per month, roughly the dues my sports club charges me to take care of my health.

We belatedly wish you a good start into 2018 and look forward to your thoughts on the association's name.
